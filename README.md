**My first NodeJS + MongoDB api**

This project is based on this tutorial [NodeJS + MongoDB - Simple API for Authentication, Registration and User Management](http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/06/14/nodejs-mongodb-simple-api-for-authentication-registration-and-user-management) by Jason Watmore.

It's a great tutorial to get started with writing REST apis with NodeJS + Expres and MongoDB.
The code is a great foundation to start from with your projects.
